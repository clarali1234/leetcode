给三个sorted list，从每个list里面选一个数使得difference最小
是的，其实就是找三个数，使得他们最大值和最小值的差最小


Start with the largest elements in each of the arrays A, B & C.
Maintain a variable to update the answer during each of the steps to be followed.
In every step, the only possible way to decrease the difference is to decrease the maximum element out of the three elements.
So traverse to the next largest element in the array containing the maximum element for this step and update the answer variable.
Repeat this step until the array containing the maximum element ends.
