# We keep a min heap of size K.
# For each item, we insert an item to our heap.
# If inserting an item makes heap size larger than k, then we immediately pop an item after inserting ( heappushpop ).

# Runtime:
# Inserting an item to a heap of size k take O(logK) time.
# And we do this for each item points.
# So runtime is O(N * logK) where N is the length of points.

# Space: O(K) for our heap.
# time O(n*lgk)
# space O(k)
