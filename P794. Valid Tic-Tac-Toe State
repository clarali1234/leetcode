To find the validity of a given board, we could first think about the cases where the board is invalid

Since X starts first, x_count >= o_count. So if o_count > x_count, we can return False
Since the players take turns, we could also return False if x_count-o_count>1
After the corner cases, this is the algorithm used:

If player O has a winning condition, also check the following:
a) If player X also has a winning condition, return False
b) If x_count != o_count , return False (Since player O always plays second, it has to meet this condition always)
If player X has a winning condition, check the following:
a) If x_count != o_count + 1, return False (Since player X plays the first move, if player X wins,
the player X's count would be 1 more than player O)
