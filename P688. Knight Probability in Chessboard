Let f[r][c][steps] be the probability of being on square (r, c) after steps steps. Based on how a knight moves,
we have the following recursion:

f[r][c][steps] = sum(f[r+dr][c+dc][steps-1] / 8.0 ^ k)

where the sum is taken over the eight (dr, dc) pairs  dirs = [(2, 1), (2, -1), (1, 2), (1, -2), 
(-2, 1), (-2, -1), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)]

Instead of using a three-dimensional array f, we will use two two-dimensional ones dp and dp2,
storing the result of the two most recent layers we are working on. dp2 will represent f[][][steps],
and dp will represent f[][][steps-1].

Time Complexity: O(N^2 K)
Space Complexity: O(N^2)
